        % xValues displacement,etc. and what we would have is a series of lines of points, and
        % in publications, what you usually get is that the points with
        % either the highest or
        % lowest values get the positions that are more outside, and then the lowest or 
        % the highest get the central position. In this function, the lowest values of yValues
        % get the external positions, and the highest values get the central positions, making
        % some sort of eyebrow or sad mouth shape)
